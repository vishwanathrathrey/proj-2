We prepare a digital strategy and roadmap for organizations.

    <h2>Professional Services</h2>
    <p>Talent sourcing via partner model is a well-established practice in the industry. Enterprises need a technology partner who is reliable and experienced like Gadgeon to meet the talent challenges quickly and effectively. We offer multiple project engagement models with flexibility and high success rates like staff augmentation – hiring a developer model; fixed cost, time & cost model; and managed agile team.

      Extended Engineering team is a joint journey where Gadgeon guides our customers by following a phased industry-standard framework for transition, service delivery, and continuous optimization. This model involves teams that are a true extension to the client's team and are mainly placed at Gadgeon's offshore development location(s). It allows maximum flexibility in the execution of multiple projects using the best-fit pricing model.
      
      When it comes to staffing solutions, one model doesn't fit all the requirements. Gadgeon's managed capacity services aim at helping customers in their digital journey by offering flexible staffing solutions where customers buy services. At the same time, Gadgeon defines and provides capacity, and the customer provides overall direction. In contrast, Gadgeon manages and control the output of the service. The processes are tailored according to the customer processes. The output is measured through agreed delivery and performance metrics and supports multiple pricing models.</p>
